# sentinel-optimizer

SentinelOptimizer is a client-side analysis tool that helps organizations migrate to
Microsoft Sentinel and optimize their data ingestion strategy. It evaluates log
sources, tables, and event volumes to identify cost-saving opportunities, reduce
noise, and streamline onboarding. No data ever leaves your browser.

> Everything runs locally. The engine only parses JSON you provide — no
> credentials, no uploads, no external calls.

## Positioning copy

- Enterprise-focused:
  SentinelOptimizer accelerates your move to Microsoft Sentinel by providing a secure,
  client-side assessment of your existing SIEM data. It maps ingestion patterns,
  highlights unnecessary or high-cost data streams, and delivers actionable
  recommendations to reduce spend and improve operational efficiency — all without
  transmitting customer data.

- Migration-focused:
  SentinelOptimizer simplifies the transition to Microsoft Sentinel by analyzing your
  current SIEM logs and identifying the optimal ingestion approach. It highlights
  redundant, noisy, or high-cost data sources and provides guidance for structuring
  your Sentinel workspace for performance and cost efficiency. All processing happens
  locally in your browser.

- Cost-optimization-focused:
  SentinelOptimizer helps organizations cut Microsoft Sentinel costs by analyzing log
  ingestion patterns and identifying waste, duplication, and unnecessary data. It
  provides clear recommendations for tuning data connectors, table usage, and
  retention settings — with all analysis performed securely on the client side.

- Short description:
  A privacy-preserving tool that helps you migrate to Microsoft Sentinel and optimize
  your log ingestion for cost, clarity, and performance.

## Trust model

- **No credentials.** Never asks for tokens, keys, or secrets.
- **Client-side only.** Parsing is pure and deterministic; nothing is stored or
  transmitted.
- **You run the queries.** Paste exported JSON from your own SIEM; the engine
  never connects to it.

## Supported vendors

Parsers implemented: **Sentinel**, **Splunk**, **Elastic**. The normalized
schema is vendor-agnostic and designed to extend to additional SIEMs.

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `schema/normalization.ts` | Canonical normalized schema + pure helpers |
| `parsers/<vendor>.ts` | Vendor-specific parsers (pure, deterministic) |
| `parsers/index.ts` | Parser registry |
| `estimators/dataVolumeEstimator.ts` | Inventory-based GB/day estimator + source catalog |
| `estimators/index.ts` | Estimator registry |
| `pricing/sentinelPricing.ts` | Sentinel monthly cost model + public rate card |
| `pricing/index.ts` | Pricing registry |
| `api/*.ts` | Optional HTTP endpoints (kept at root for portable backend deployment) |
| `samples/<vendor>.json` | Sample query/export output used by tests |
| `test/` | Unit tests (Vitest) |

## Normalized schema

Every parser returns the same shape:

```ts
{
  vendor: string,
  sources: [
    { name: string, events?: number, bytes?: number, gbPerDay?: number, storage?: string }
  ],
  connectors?: [...],
  dcrs?: [...],
  totals?: { gbPerDay?: number, events?: number, bytes?: number }
}
```

## Usage

```ts
import { parseSentinel } from "./parsers/index.js";

// `usage` is the JSON output of a KQL Usage query you ran in your tenant.
const result = parseSentinel({ usage, windowDays: 30 });
console.log(result.totals?.gbPerDay);
```

### Example: Microsoft Sentinel (KQL)

Run this in Log Analytics, then paste the JSON result:

```kql
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize QuantityMB = sum(Quantity) by DataType
```

`Quantity` in the `Usage` table is reported in MBytes, and is commonly
converted to GB by dividing by 1000 in Microsoft examples.

### Example: Splunk (SPL)

```spl
index=_internal source=*license_usage.log type=Usage
| stats sum(b) as bytes by idx
```

### Example: Elasticsearch

```http
GET _cat/indices?format=json&bytes=b
```

## Data Volume Estimator

When no logs are available yet, estimate Sentinel ingestion volume from an
infrastructure inventory — node/endpoint/user counts per data-source type. No
logs, credentials, or live environment are touched; it is a pure calculation.

```ts
import { estimateDataVolume } from "./estimators/index.js";

const result = estimateDataVolume({
  rows: [
    { name: "Windows Servers w/ medium EPS", count: 200 },
    { name: "Network Firewalls (DMZ)", count: 4 },
  ],
});
console.log(result.totals?.gbPerDay);
```

Each source type carries a default average event size and events-per-second
(see `DATA_SOURCE_CATALOG`), both overridable per row. Volume is computed with:

```text
GB/day = (avgEventSizeBytes × (count × avgEpsPerNode) × 86400) / 1024³
```

The estimator output uses the same normalized schema as the vendor parsers, so
it feeds directly into cost modeling and optimization.

## Cost model

Turn normalized ingestion volume into an estimated monthly Sentinel cost. Rates
default to Microsoft Sentinel's public, per-GB list pricing (USD) and are fully
overridable for region, currency, or negotiated tiers.

```ts
import { estimateMonthlyCost } from "./pricing/index.js";

const cost = estimateMonthlyCost({
  analyticsGbPerDay: 500,
  dataLakeGbPerDay: 2000,
  searchTbPerMonth: 500,
  benefits: { m365E5FreeGbPerDay: 50, defenderP2FreeGbPerDay: 30 },
});
console.log(cost.monthlyCost, cost.breakdown);
```

The model covers Analytics and Data Lake ingestion, interactive retention (with
the free window), long-term storage, data search, SOAR, Security Copilot, and
Sentinel for SAP. It also accounts for free-ingestion benefits (Microsoft 365
E5, Defender for Servers P2, always-free sources) and an optional weekend
ingestion-optimization discount. Pass a `NormalizedResult` directly with
`estimateMonthlyCostFromResult(result, options)`.

For data lake storage, the default model applies a 6:1 raw-to-billable
compression ratio, which aligns with current Microsoft Sentinel data lake
documentation.

All rates live in `DEFAULT_SENTINEL_RATES`; nothing is hard-coded to a customer
or contract.

Rates and meter semantics can change by region, offer, and date. Validate
production decisions with the Azure pricing calculator and current vendor billing
exports.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test          # run the Vitest suite
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

Parsers are pure and deterministic, and each vendor has a sample fixture in
`samples/` plus a unit test in `test/`.

## Frontend/backend deployment modes

The repo is structured so API and frontend can be deployed together or
independently:

- Frontend app: `web/`
- API handlers: `api/`

For Cloudflare Pages builds that expect a `functions/` directory under `web/`,
the web project provides a staging build that dynamically creates
`web/functions/api` from root `api/` before building:

```bash
cd web
npm run build:pages
```

This keeps source-of-truth handlers in one place (`api/`) while remaining
compatible with platforms that expect framework-local functions folders.

## Branch hardening (dev and production)

- `dev` is the integration branch for active changes.
- `main` is the production/stable branch.

To keep both paths shored up, this repo includes:

- CI on both branches and their PRs: `.github/workflows/ci-dev-main.yml`
  - Root engine: `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`
  - Web app: `web npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`
- Promotion safety gate: `.github/workflows/promotion-gate.yml`
  - Validates that `main` is an ancestor of `dev` (fast-forwardable promotion path)
  - Prevents unnoticed branch divergence before release promotion

Recommended release flow:

1. Merge feature work into `dev` only.
2. Keep `dev` green via CI.
3. Promote `dev` to `main` with a PR once the promotion gate passes.
