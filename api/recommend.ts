/**
 * Cloudflare Pages Function — POST /api/recommend
 *
 * Optional AI enhancement endpoint. It accepts ONLY an aggregated, non-
 * identifying numeric summary (the AggregatedSummary shape from the client),
 * calls Workers AI server-side, and returns prose. It never receives or stores
 * raw logs.
 *
 * If the Workers AI binding (env.AI) is not configured, it returns HTTP 501 so
 * the client can gracefully fall back to its deterministic recommendations.
 *
 * Bind Workers AI in the Pages project settings (Functions -> Bindings -> AI),
 * or in wrangler.toml:  [ai]  binding = "AI"
